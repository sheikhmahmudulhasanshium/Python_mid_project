{'name': 'as', 'details': 'If you want access to the results of the expression or context manager passed to with, you’ll need to alias it using as. You may have also seen as used to alias imports and exceptions, and this is no different. The alias is available in the with block', 'sample_code': 'with <expr> as <alias>:\n\t<statements>'} 
{'name': 'pass', 'details': 'Since Python doesn’t have block indicators to specify the end of a block, the pass keyword is used to specify that the block is intentionally left blank.

{'name': 'yield', 'details': 'Python’s yield keyword is kind of like the return keyword in that it specifies what gets returned from a function. However, when a function has a yield statement, what gets returned is a generator. The generator can then be passed to Python’s built-in next() to get the next value returned from the function.When you call a function with yield statements, Python executes the function until it reaches the first yield keyword and then returns a generator.

These are except, else, and finally:', 'sample_code': 'def mpg(miles, gallons):\n\t try:\n\t\t mpg = miles / gallons\n\t except ZeroDivisionError:\n\t\t mpg = None\n\treturn mpg'}

{'name': 'assert', 'details': 'The assert keyword in Python is used to specify an assert statement, or an assertion about an expression.

To define an assertion, use assert followed by an expression:', 'sample_code': 'assert <expr>'}
